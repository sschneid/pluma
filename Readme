pluma readme & notes


1. Requirements
-------------------

pluma requires the following perl modules (and their dependencies) for basic
operations:

    - CGI::Application
    - MIME::Lite
    - Net::LDAP

All modules can be installed from CPAN.



2. OpenLDAP considerations
------------------------------

pluma was written and tested against Fedora Directory Server (now "389").
That said, it will work fine with OpenLDAP, with a few exceptions:

* RFC2307bis schema is required for POSIX group support

    - posixGroup is marked as AUXILIARY instead of STRUCTURAL, allowing both
      posixGroup and groupOfUniqueNames object classes to be set (in turn,
      allowing both gidNumber and uniqueMember attributes to be allowed in
      a group object).

* Host attributes are not allowed

    - This causes a "LDAP error: invalid structural object class chain
      (inetOrgPerson/account)" to be thrown during account creation.  Both
      account and posixAccount are STRUCTURAL, disallowing the 'host' attribute
      to be set on a user object.  This is not fixed with RFC2307bis, though a
      manual schema modification to set either posixAccount or account as
      AUXILIARY will fix this.  You can also disable hosts entirely via
      $user.POSIX.Hosts.

    - Example:
    
        $user.POSIX.Hosts: "0"

* Disabling of users is not supported

    - Hopefully this will change in a future release.

Thanks to Peter McNabb <peter@mcnabbs.org> for help and patching to enable
OpenLDAP support!
