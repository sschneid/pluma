pluma installation


1. View and edit pluma.cfg
------------------------------

pluma reads in most of it's configuration directives through a flat text configruation file (pluma.cfg).  This file must be in the located in the base of pluma's application directory.

* Format is:

    $variable: "value"

* LDAP server information

    - $domain is the DNS domain name of the LDAP server
    - $ldap.Server is the FQDN of the LDAP server
    - $ldap.SSL turns SSL on (1) or off (0)

    - Example:

        $domain: "company.com"
        $ldap.Server "ldap.$domain"
        $ldap.SSL: "1"

* LDAP DN set-up

    - The base DNs for users, hosts, and groups must all be set-up within the configuration file.

    - Example:

        $ldap.Base: "dc=company,dc=com"
        $ldap.Base.User: "ou=People,$ldap.Base"
        $ldap.Base.Host: "ou=Hosts,$ldap.Base"
        $ldap.Base.Group: "ou=Groups,$ldap.Base"

* LDAP bind account

    - An LDAP account with sufficient access to the user, host, and groups must be set-up and specified.

    - Example:

        $auth.BindDN: "uid=pluma,$ldap.Base.User"
        $auth.Password: "plum4p455w0rd!"

* LDAP defaults

    - Default shells (@shells) and GID ($default.GID) must both be set.

    - Example:

        @shells: "/bin/bash /bin/ksh"
        $default.GID: "100"

* Internal LDAP limits

    - Limits can be set to help alleviate server congestion.

    - Example:

        $fetch.Limit.Size: 1000
        $fetch.Limit.Time: 30



2. Apache set-up
----------------

Web set-up should be relatively simple.  Full Apache set-up is outside of the scope of this installation document.

* AuthLDAP is required for Apache set-up.

    - Example:

        <Directory /var/www/pluma>
            Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks

            AllowOverride None

            AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
            DirectoryIndex index.cgi

            AuthType Basic
            AuthName "pluma"

            AuthLDAPEnabled on
            AuthLDAPAuthoritative on
            AuthLDAPURL ldaps://ldap.company.com/dc=company,dc=com?uid

            Require valid-user

            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
